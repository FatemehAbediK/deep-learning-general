# deep-learning-general

#DL-fashion-mnist:
a comparison between ANN and CNN for fashion mnist data set.
the val_accuracy of 1 or 100% is due to we assume our validation set as same as the test set(no prior splitting)


#CNN-mnist:
a comparison of maxpooling & average pooling with and without batch normalization on mnist dataset


#CNN-mnist-1:
seeing the effect of callbacks(early stopping)


#ANN-numbers:
checking  a DL model for a number dataset that we make from sklearn.make_classification with and without early stopping 


#CNN_numbers_best_params:
have gridsearch cv & randomizedsearch cv for finding the best params in cnn for a number dataset that we make from sklearn.make_classification 


#building_the_U_Net_model_itself_in_Keras:
code the U-NET model in keras!!!!!
